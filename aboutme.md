subtitle: A little bit about myself.

Hi I'm Peter and I graduated from MIT this February with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I started pursuing a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science this spring, but have decided to take a break and pursue industry and gain real-world work experience. My interests are in software development and data science, and I am incredibly passionate about engaging with the latest technology developments and contributing where I can.

I am currently a returning summer technology intern at Capital One, where I am working with senior tech leads and data engineers to develop a recommendation system for users who are seeking Airbnb's, hotels, and other forms of lodging while traveling. During my masterâ€™s thesis, I worked with AstraZeneca to create statistical inference algorithms to predict protein-compound interacts with 90% accuracy for drug development. I have also conducted research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and have published in the Clinical Cancer Research journal, as well as the MIT Media Lab, where our research will be presented this July in an IEEE conference. Through these experiences and others, I have gained exposure to Python, distributed systems, and system design.
