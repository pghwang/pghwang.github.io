subtitle: A little bit about myself.
---

Hi, I’m Peter, and I graduated from MIT this February with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I started pursuing a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science this spring but have decided to take a break and pursue industry and gain real-world work experience. My interests are in software development and data science, and I am incredibly passionate about engaging with the latest technology developments and contributing where I can.

I am a returning summer technology intern at Capital One, working to develop a recommendation system for users seeking Airbnbs, hotels, and other forms of lodging while traveling. During my master’s thesis, I worked with AstraZeneca to create statistical inference algorithms to predict protein-compound interactions with 90% accuracy for drug development. I have also conducted research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard that we published in the Clinical Cancer Research journal. I have pursued research at the MIT Media Lab, which my advisor will present at an IEEE conference this July. Through these experiences and others, I have gained exposure to software engineering, machine learning, and system design.

I am seeking full-time, new graduate software engineering roles! Please feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website!
